a:T454,Deep neural networks face the critical challenge of adversarial vulnerability: imperceptible perturbations can drastically alter predictions. Empirical defenses, such as adversarial training, improve robustness against known attacks but often fail under stronger or adaptive adversaries. In contrast, certified robustness provides provable guarantees that a model’s prediction remains stable within a prescribed perturbation region. This tutorial introduces two complementary approaches: Lipschitz-constrained networks, which enforce global sensitivity bounds via spectral norm regularization, convex potentials, and contractive architectures, yielding deterministic certificates; and randomized smoothing, a probabilistic method that transforms any classifier into a certifiably robust model by adding Gaussian noise and averaging predictions. We will also highlight applications across natural language processing, datacentric AI, and foundation models, illustrating how certification principles extend to robustness against diverse perturbations, data quality issues, and large-scale multimodal systems.b:T445,The goal of this tutorial is to provide machine learning researchers and practitioners with a clear guideline for adapting Foundation Models in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This tutorial moves beyond a simple catalog of PEFT techniques to introduce Neural Network Reprogrammability as a unifying framework that explains how and why modern PEFT methods work. The audience will learn to view techniques, e.g., prompt tuning, in-context learning, and model reprogramming, not as isolated methodologies, but as principled instances of a shared underlying idea: repurposing a fixed pre-trained model by strategically manipulating information at its interfaces. Attendees will walk away with a structured understanding of the adaptation lifecycle: from input manipulation to output alignment. The tutorial will synthesize existing methodologies and practical applications with a cohesive principle, enabling attendees to better analyze, choose, and design adaptation strategies for their own projects, without incurring substantial costs when fine-tuning Foundation Models.0:{"P":null,"b":"fnE031yM9tXe8Gg4bqKWc","p":"/2025","c":["","program","tutorials"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["(main)",{"children":["program",{"children":["tutorials",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/2025/_next/static/css/8eaeb22d09b90636.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_6dda44 subpixel-antialiased min-h-screen flex flex-col","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}],["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","$L5",null,{}],["$","$L6",null,{}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"name\":\"ADC 2025 - Australasian Database Conference\",\"description\":\"Welcome to the 36th Australasian Database Conference, ADC 2025.
