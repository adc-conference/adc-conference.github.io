2:T436,Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5 million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites, spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with cross-species and cross-task capabilities.0:{"buildId":"yiNaxz0KEyLkAZ00krylK","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold mb-2","children":"Invited Talks"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"w-[4em] h-[5px] bg-gradient-to-r from-primary from-30% to-secondary mb-10"}],["$","article",null,{"className":"pb-10","children":[["$","section","1",{"children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-primary uppercase tracking-[0.1em] mb-2 font-semibold","children":"Special Session: Data in Agriculture"}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-2xl mb-2 text-gray-600 leading-9","children":"Foundation Models for Wheat: A Data-Centric Odyssey"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"text-sm mt-6 mb-6 list-disc list-inside","children":[["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"font-semibold inline md:min-w-30 md:inline-block","children":"Venue:"}]," ","Bali (in-person)"]}],"$undefined",["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"font-semibold inline md:min-w-30 md:inline-block","children":"Bali Time:"}]," ","Fri, 5 Dec 2025 15:00 - 16:00 WITA (UTC+8)"]}]]}],[["$","p","0",{"className":"mb-3","children":"$2"}]],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center space-x-2 mt-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-0 h-0 border-t-[0.6em] border-t-transparent border-l-[1em] border-gray-600 border-b-[0.6em] border-b-transparent"}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600","children":"Speaker"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-gray-100 mt-4 rounded-xl","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://sites.google.com/site/poppinace/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener","className":"flex items-center mb-2 mr-5 w-fit float-start border-gray-100 border-2 rounded-tl-xl","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/2025/images/people/Hao-Lu.png","alt":"Hao Lu","className":"w-32 h-32 rounded-tl-xl object-cover shadow-lg"}]}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://sites.google.com/site/poppinace/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener","className":"flex flex-col pt-5 pb-2 hover:text-primary transition-colors duration-300","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-[1.2em]","children":"Hao Lu"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500 font-medium text-[0.95em]","children":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600 text-[0.9em] px-4 pb-4","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"block pb-2","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://sites.google.com/site/poppinace/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener","className":"hover:text-primary transition-colors duration-300","children":"Hao Lu"}]," ","is an Associate Professor with Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
