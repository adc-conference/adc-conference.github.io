8:T469,is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Auckland, where he is also the Director of Data Science in the birthplace of R, the world’s most used language for statistical analysis. As the Associate Dean International for Science, Sebastian has helped establish many transnational education programmes with leading universities in China and elsewhere. His contributions to data management earned Sebastian the 2013 Chris Wallace Award, the most prestigious research award for mid-career Computer Scientists in Australasia. He was also awarded a Doctor of Science by the University of Auckland in 2015. Sebastian’s research spans data dependency theory, data profiling for which he co-founded the company DataViadotto, conceptual and logical database design for a diverse range of data models. He has published in all top database conferences and journals, is currently on the editorial board of the VLDB Journal and Information Systems, and a regular member of Senior Programme Committees such as SIGMOD, CIKM, EDBT, and ER. Sebastian has led many prestigious research grants in New Zealand to successful outcomes.0:{"P":null,"b":"De9cuGbfWK-uHlfhm-lSn","p":"/2025","c":["","program","keynote-talks"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["(main)",{"children":["program",{"children":["keynote-talks",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/2025/_next/static/css/cb075226591b64b7.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_6dda44 subpixel-antialiased min-h-screen flex flex-col","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}],["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"name\":\"ADC 2025 - Australasian Database Conference\",\"description\":\"Welcome to the 36th Australasian Database Conference, ADC 2025.
