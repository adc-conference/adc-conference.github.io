It will be demonstrated that E/R diagrams constitute a subclass of property graph schemata whose instances are E/R graphs that are designed well, referring to the absence of data redundancy and processing difficulty on target workloads. Furthermore, E/R graphs offer new opportunities in the management of entity and referential integrity. As a proof of concept, we showcase how the famous relational TPC-H benchmark performs when its schema, instances and workloads are translated into Neo4j."}]],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center space-x-2 mt-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-0 h-0 border-t-[0.6em] border-t-transparent border-l-[1em] border-gray-600 border-b-[0.6em] border-b-transparent"}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600","children":"Speaker"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-gray-100 mt-4 rounded-xl","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/s-link","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener","className":"flex items-center mb-2 mr-5 w-fit float-start border-gray-100 border-2 rounded-tl-xl","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/2025/images/people/Sebastian-Link.png","alt":"Sebastian Link","className":"w-32 h-32 rounded-tl-xl object-cover shadow-lg"}]}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/s-link","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener","className":"flex flex-col pt-5 pb-2 hover:text-primary transition-colors duration-300","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-[1.2em]","children":"Sebastian Link"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500 font-medium text-[0.95em]","children":"University of Auckland"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600 text-[0.9em] px-4 pb-4","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"block pb-2","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/s-link","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener","className":"hover:text-primary transition-colors duration-300","children":"Sebastian Link"}]," ","$b"]}]]}]]}],false]}]]}]]}],["$","$Lc",null,{"children":"$Ld"}],null,["$","$Le",null,{"children":["$Lf","$L10",["$","$L11",null,{"promise":"$@12"}]]}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$1","wE4b5QbC6vKFRWfHa5lnT",{"children":[["$","$L13",null,{"children":"$L14"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"next-size-adjust","content":""}]]}],null]}],false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$15","$undefined"],"s":false,"S":true}
