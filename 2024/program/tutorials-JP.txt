3:T66e,With the rapid advancement of digital agriculture, data-driven solutions have become increasingly essential in tackling complex agricultural challenges. Data-driven approaches like machine learning require high-quality, labelled data to train robust and accurate algorithms. To support these efforts, the Global Wheat project has introduced two transformative datasets: Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) and Global Wheat Full Semantic Segmentation (GWFSS). The GWHD dataset is pivotal for precise wheat head detection, while the GWFSS dataset enables detailed segmentation within intricate wheat canopies, capturing components like leaves, stems, and inflorescences. These datasets highlight the critical role of expertly curated data in powering effective AI solutions. While human-annotated data is invaluable for training models, the process is often labour-intensive, costly, and challenging to scale. Addressing these issues, the EasyDAM series offers an innovative, automated approach to data annotation through generative AI, reducing the reliance on human labelling in detection tasks. EasyDAM complements initiatives like Global Wheat by providing a generative AI solution for self-annotation, addressing the domain gap between crop types. This approach allows a model trained on one crop to adapt seamlessly to another with minimal labelled data, enhancing adaptability and reducing the burden of data annotation. Together, this talk will explore the construction, outcomes, and future potential of these resources and techniques, offering insights into how they are driving the next generation of data-driven solutions in agriculture.0:["l1lliweEI-Ot_JJuOYSMb",[[["",{"children":["program",{"children":["tutorials-JP",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["program",{"children":["tutorials-JP",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-6 bg-gray-900 ","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[70em] h-[4em] mx-auto flex justify-between pr-3.5 pl-5 md:pl-8 lg:pl-10","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"py-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold block ","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":"A"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"D"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-600","children":"C"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-primary","children":"2024"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500 font-semibold block text-xs mt-[-0.2em]","children":"Gold Coast, AU & Tokyo, JP"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex text-gray-100","children":["$","$L2",null,{}]}]]}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-[70em] w-full min-h-[500px] mx-auto relative px-5 md:px-8 lg:px-10","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"mt-10 mb-2  uppercase text-3xl font-bold text-primary tracking-wide mb-8","children":"Tutorials in Tokyo 🇯🇵"}],["$","article",null,{"className":"pb-10","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-red-600 uppercase tracking-[0.2em] mb-2 font-semibold","children":"Tutorial 1"}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-2xl mb-2","children":"Security, Privacy, and Trust in Generative AI"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"italic text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"font-bold","children":"Gold Coast Time:"}]," Tue 16 Dec 2024 15:30 AEST (UTC+10)"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"italic text-sm","children":[" ",["$","span",null,{"className":"font-bold","children":"Tokyo Time:"}]," Tue 16 Dec 2024 14:30 JST (UTC+9)"]}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-8","children":"▶  Abstract"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2 pl-6 pr-6","children":"Generative AI systems possess vast capabilities that can significantly enhance creativity and streamline daily business processes.
