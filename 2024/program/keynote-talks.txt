3:T516,Data change, all the time.  The Janus project seeks to model, explore, and analyze such change, providing valuable insights into the evolving real world and the ways in which data about it are collected and used.  We start by identifying technical challenges that need to be addressed to realize the Janus vision.  Based on an analysis of the history of 3.5M tables on the English Wikipedia for a total of 53.8M table versions, we then illustrate the rich history of structured Wikipedia data: their creation, evolution, and deletion; indeed, each table has a life of its own.  To help automatically interpret the useful knowledge harbored in the history of Wikipedia tables, we present recent results on two technical problems that help infer identity of entities and tables across changes over time: (i) matching tables, infoboxes and lists within a Wikipedia page across page revisions, and (ii) identifying Natural Keys, which serves as a primary key in tables over time and consists of attributes inherent to an entity.  Finally, we show how to accurately recommend schema changes to Wikipedia tables, based on rules derived from the history of past schema changes.  We solve these problems at scale and make the resulting curated datasets available to the community to facilitate future research.4:T486, is the Arthur S.
