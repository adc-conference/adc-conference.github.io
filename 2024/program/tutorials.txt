3:T427,Nearest Neighbour Search is a critical technique for queries involving vectors, however due to the Curse of Dimensionality modern solutions scale incredibly poorly for high dimensional vectors. As a result, the problem of Approximate Nearest Neighbourhood Search has become the most practical solution for high dimensional datasets, sacrificing the need for perfect accuracy in exchange for reasonable runtime. A common method to improve the efficiency of Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search is the adoption of an index, with one of the most popular options being a Graph-Based Index. These solutions are attractive as they can effectively provide a comparable level of usability regardless. In this tutorial we will explore various graph-based indexes proposed over time which declare to be a usable option. To do so we will examine the foundational ideas behind their models as well as discuss the shortcomings behind their designs. We will also raise questions regarding the future direction of graph-based indexes and their practicality for vector databases.0:["VPwzx0w399cqRUWZYG8UD",[[["",{"children":["program",{"children":["tutorials",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["program",{"children":["tutorials",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-6 bg-gray-900 ","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[70em] h-[4em] mx-auto flex justify-between pr-3.5 pl-5 md:pl-8 lg:pl-10","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"py-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold block ","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":"A"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"D"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-600","children":"C"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-primary","children":"2024"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500 font-semibold block text-xs mt-[-0.2em]","children":"Gold Coast, AU & Tokyo, JP"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex text-gray-100","children":["$","$L2",null,{}]}]]}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-[70em] w-full min-h-[500px] mx-auto relative px-5 md:px-8 lg:px-10","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"mt-10 mb-2  uppercase text-3xl font-bold text-primary tracking-wide mb-8","children":"Tutorials in Gold Coast ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º"}],["$","article",null,{"className":"pb-10","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-red-600 uppercase tracking-[0.2em] mb-2 font-semibold","children":"Tutorial 1"}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-2xl mb-2","children":"Graph-Based Indexes for Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"italic text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"font-bold","children":"Gold Coast Time:"}]," Tue 16 Dec 2024 15:30 AEST (UTC+10)"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"italic text-sm","children":[" ",["$","span",null,{"className":"font-bold","children":"Tokyo Time:"}]," Tue 16 Dec 2024 14:30 JST (UTC+9)"]}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-8","children":"â–¶Â Â Abstract"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2 pl-6 pr-6","children":"$3"}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-8","children":"â–¶Â Â Speaker"}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/comp/people/academic-staff/dr-zhou-alexander/","target":"_blank","className":"flex items-center mb-6 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/2024/images/zhoualexander.jpg","alt":"Mengxuan Zhang","className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full mr-4 object-cover"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl","children":"Zhou Alexander"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}]]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","a",null,{"className":"font-bold text-red-1000 hover:text-red-500 transition-colors duration-300","href":"https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/comp/people/academic-staff/dr-zhou-alexander/","children":"Zhou Alexander"}]," is a Research Assistant Professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

A common approach to DNN verification involves discomposing the network into multiple layers of neurons, where linear and non-linear operations (activation functions) stack to form the networkâ€™s overall function. The key challenge lies in constructing linear constraints that effectively bound those non-linear activation functions â€“ a technique known as function hull over-approximation. In this tutorial, we introduce WraLU (Wrapping ReLU), our novel approach for computing the convex hull of the ReLU function. WraLU enables the construction of multi-neuron constraints for verifying ReLU-based DNNs. It significantly reduces computation time and constraint number to improving efficiency in high-dimensional settings."}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-8","children":"â–¶Â Â Speaker"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap items-center","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/24584","target":"_blank","className":"flex items-center mb-6 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/2024/images/guangdongbai.jpeg","alt":"Guangdong Bai","className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full mr-4 object-cover"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl","children":"Guangdong Bai"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"University of Queensland"}]]}]]}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://zhongkuima.github.io/index.html","target":"_blank","className":"flex items-center mb-6 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/2024/images/zhongkuima.png","alt":"Zhongkui Ma","className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full mr-4 object-cover"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl","children":"Zhongkui Ma"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"University of Queensland"}]]}]]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","a",null,{"className":"font-bold text-red-1000 hover:text-red-500 transition-colors duration-300","href":"https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/24584","children":" Guangdong Bai"}]," is an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Queensland, Australia.

However, LLMs are typically based on the autoregressive transformer architecture, which generates output tokens step by step and thus suffers from high latency, particularly with larger model sizes. To reduce LLM serving latency, speculative decoding has been proposed as a viable solution, where a small draft model produces speculated output sequences that are verified by the large target model in parallel to achieve a faster decoding speed. In this tutorial, I will first introduce existing work on speculative decoding. I will then present our recently proposed speculative decoding method called GliDe with a CaPE that introduces two low-hassle modifications to vanilla speculative decoding to improve the speedup."}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-8","children":"â–¶Â Â Speaker"}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/jing-jiang/","target":"_blank","className":"flex items-center mb-6 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/2024/images/jingjiang.jpeg","alt":"Jing Jiang","className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full mr-4 object-cover"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl","children":"Jing Jiang"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"Australian National University"}]]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","a",null,{"className":"font-bold text-red-1000 hover:text-red-500 transition-colors duration-300","href":"https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/jing-jiang/","children":"Jing Jiang"}]," is a Professor in the School of Computing at the Australian National University.
