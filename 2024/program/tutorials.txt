A common approach to DNN verification involves discomposing the network into multiple layers of neurons, where linear and non-linear operations (activation functions) stack to form the network’s overall function. The key challenge lies in constructing linear constraints that effectively bound those non-linear activation functions – a technique known as function hull over-approximation. In this tutorial, we introduce WraLU (Wrapping ReLU), our novel approach for computing the convex hull of the ReLU function. WraLU enables the construction of multi-neuron constraints for verifying ReLU-based DNNs. It significantly reduces computation time and constraint number to improving efficiency in high-dimensional settings."}],["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-8","children":"▶  Speaker"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap items-center","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/24584","target":"_blank","className":"flex items-center mb-6 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/2024/images/guangdongbai.jpeg","alt":"Guangdong Bai","className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full mr-4 object-cover"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl","children":"AProf Guangdong Bai"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"University of Queensland"}]]}]]}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://zhongkuima.github.io/index.html","target":"_blank","className":"flex items-center mb-6 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/2024/images/zhongkuima.png","alt":"Zhongkui Ma","className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full mr-4 object-cover"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"font-bold text-xl","children":"Zhongkui Ma"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"University of Queensland"}]]}]]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2 pl-6 pr-6","children":[["$","a",null,{"className":"font-bold text-red-1000 hover:text-red-500 transition-colors duration-300","href":"https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/24584","children":"AProf Guangdong Bai"}]," is an Associate Professor at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland, Australia.
